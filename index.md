### Welcome to the bellpeppers & beef rule page!

- Be friendly and nice to each other. Lets all have a good time listening to good music.

- Please don't stay afk for too long or you'll eventually get kicked of the stage.

### Genres

- The genres we play here are mostly hip-hop, electronic & jazz, but were open to almost anything. No watered down                   
  commercial pop/edm please.
- If you're joining into an active session, try to catch the vibe of the music being played and go with that.
