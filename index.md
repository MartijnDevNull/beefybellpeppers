## welcome to the bellpeppers & beef rule page!

  be friendly and nice to each other. lets all have a good time listening to good music.

  please don't stay afk for too long or you'll eventually get kicked of the stage.

**genres**

  the genres we play here are mostly hip-hop, electronic & jazz, but were open to anything thats good stuff. no watered down                   
  commercial pop please.
  if you're joining into an active session, try to catch the vibe of the music being played and go with that.
